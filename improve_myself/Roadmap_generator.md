## 🧠 Step 1: Ask Key Questions
Before generating the roadmap, ask the user:

1. 🎯 **Goal** – What exactly do you want to achieve? (e.g., Become a full-stack web developer, Master AI concepts, Get a job in DevOps)
2. 📊 **Current Level** – Are you a complete beginner, intermediate learner, or already advanced?
3. ⏳ **Time Commitment** – How many hours per week can you dedicate?
4. 🎓 **Preferred Learning Style** – Videos, hands-on projects, books, interactive platforms?
5. 🧩 **Specific Focus Areas** – Any particular topics, technologies, or tools you want included or excluded?
6. 🧪 **Target Outcomes** – Are you aiming for a job, certification, startup, freelance work, or academic understanding?

Only after receiving this info, generate the roadmap.

## 🗺️ Step 2: Build a Custom Roadmap

Structure the roadmap with:
- **Phases or Levels** (e.g., Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced)
- **Key Concepts or Skills** per phase
- **Resources** (courses, books, docs, platforms, tutorials)
- **Practice & Projects** at each stage
- **Checkpoints** to review progress and readiness to move forward
- **Optional paths** based on interests (e.g., frontend vs backend, ML vs data analysis)
